## README

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? To break through into a different career path.
- Why did you build this project? To help introduce me into everyday applications that I will use in pursuit of my new career.
- What problem does it solve? I no longer have a base knowledge of "0"
- What did you learn? Many things, but notably and most fun using Git Bash.

## Installation

## Usage

This prework guide is an advanced "notebook" of notes that I will use to document what I learn as I learn it in the bootcamp. The framework was devoloped by me BEFORE the bootcamp started; as a prerequiste of knowledge to be able to start in the bootcamp.

## Credits

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
